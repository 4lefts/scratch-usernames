# Scratch Username Generator

A simple web app to generate random usernames for teachers running classes on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

Allows selecting number of usernames to generate, and default password for each user.

Built using [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)

## To do:

- Redesign UI. Very dull at the moment
  - Main page: title, footer, input boxes and generate button
  - Outputs user names as a grid of cards, plus "start again" button
  - "i" button to display "about" text
- Allow cards to be downloaded/printed for handing out
